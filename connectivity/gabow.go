// Gabow's Algorithm is a linear time algorithm to find strongly connected
// components in a directed graph. It is similar to Tarjan's Algorithm in
// that it uses a stack to keep track of the current strongly connected
// component, but it uses a different approach to find the strongly connected
// components.
//
// The algorithm works by using a depth-first search, but it does not use
// recursion. Instead, it keeps track of the vertices visited so far in an
// array called visited. When a vertex is visited for the first time, it is
// added to the stack and marked as visited. Then, it visits all of its
// neighbors and adds them to the stack if they have not been visited before.
// If a neighbor is already on the stack, then it is part of the same strongly
// connected component, so Gabow's Algorithm keeps track of the minimum index
// of any vertex on the stack that can be reached from the neighbor. This
// minimum index is called the lowLink of the vertex.
//
// When the depth-first search is complete, the algorithm checks if the current
// vertex is the root of a strongly connected component. This is true if the
// lowLink of the vertex is equal to its index. If the vertex is the root of
// a strongly connected component, it pops all the vertices on the stack with
// indices greater than or equal to the vertex's index and adds them to a new
// strongly connected component.
//
// The algorithm continues in this way until all vertices have been visited.
// The resulting strongly connected components are returned by the algorithm.

// Gabow runs the Gabow's algorithm, and returns a list of strongly
// connected components, where each component is represented as an
// array of pointers to vertex structs.
