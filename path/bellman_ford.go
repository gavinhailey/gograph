// BellmanFord finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices
// in a weighted graph, even in the presence of negative weight edges, as long as
// there are no negative weight cycle.
//
// Steps:
//
//		1.Initialization: Start by setting the distance of the source vertex to itself
//	    as 0, and the distance of all other vertices to infinity.
//
//		2. Relaxation: Iterate through all edges in the graph |V| - 1 times, where |V|
//		is the number of vertices. In each iteration, attempt to improve the shortest
//		path estimates for all vertices. This is done by relaxing each edge: if the distance
//		to the destination vertex through the current edge is shorter than the current
//		estimate, update the estimate with the shorter distance.
//
//		3.Detection of Negative Cycles: After the |V| - 1 iterations, perform an additional
//		iteration. If during this iteration, any of the distances are further reduced, it
//		indicates the presence of a negative weight cycle in the graph. This is because if a
//		vertex's distance can still be improved after |V| - 1 iterations, it means there's a
//		negative weight cycle that can be traversed indefinitely to reduce the distance further.
//
//		4.Output: If there is no negative weight cycle, the algorithm outputs the shortest path
//		distances from the source vertex to all other vertices. If there is a negative weight
//		cycle, the algorithm typically returns an indication of this fact.
//
// The time complexity of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is O(V*E), where V is the number of vertices
// and E is the number of edges.
